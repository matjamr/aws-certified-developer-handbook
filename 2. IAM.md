IAM is identity and access management

Root account by default created, shouldnt be used or shared

Users are people in organization, which can be divided into different groups
Groups only contains users (cannot contain group)
Users can be without group and can be assigned to many groups


Users or groups can be assigned json document called IAM polices, which will directly 
assign them permissions

In AWS least privilege principle is needed to be applied

Users are not region specific

We can operate on IAM login url via alias for example

https://aws-bober-v1.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


IAM polices inheritance

IAM consists of:
- version
- Id
- statement (sid, effect, principal, resource, condition)


IAM statement -> when having in actions: 'iam:...' we can specify directly which policies to assign (* also works, fe. GET*)

Password Policy -> Set password for minimum length and specific chars, allow to mnanage thier own, password reuse and expiration

IAM MFA policy -> MultiFactor authentication
